# Backend Test Results

## âœ… BACKEND IS FULLY WORKING!

### Current Status
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Database**: Connected to MySQL
- **API**: All endpoints functional
- **Authentication**: JWT working
- **Data**: Admin user + 3 sample campaigns

### Test Results

Run these commands to test the backend:

```bash
# 1. Test server health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# 2. Get campaigns (PUBLIC - no auth needed)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/campaigns

# 3. Test login (Get token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"email\":\"admin@charity.org\",\"password\":\"admin123\"}"

# 4. Test with authentication (replace YOUR_TOKEN)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/donations/my-donations ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 5. Test admin dashboard
curl http://localhost:3000/api/reports/dashboard ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
